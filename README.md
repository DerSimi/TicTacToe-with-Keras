# TicTacToe-with-Keras

This is a project to detect the winner of a tic tac toe game.

I'm not a student of computer science and frankly, I'm **not** a machine learning expert, I just read a book about it.

The project itself worked worse than expected. I got only a accuracy on the test set(With a bit of luck) of 85%.

**Of course is a neural network not the best idea to detect the winner. It's much easier implement it by hand.**

However, this project was just a test (or a waste of time?).

train_data_generator.py could be useful. You see how the generator works when you open the file. The important parts are commented.

Also is a dataset included, so you can test it on our own machine and perhaps, you can improve it :D

Simplifying the data could make it more "understandable" for the network.
